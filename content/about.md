Hi! I'm an undergraduate at Yale University studying Mathematics and Economics. 

While I probably would call Processing Stochasticities my blog, I really want the focus to be on the ideas and projects, not on me.

In case you'd like to learn a bit about *me*, feel free to look [here](/hidden/about_hidden/). 

Processing Stochasticity's mission statement is to be maximally curious, aggressively interdisciplinary, and to represent familiar ideas in intriguing ways. 

And to have a bit of fun on the side.

In case you're interested in the code underlying the site, feel free to check out the source code for the [main site](http://localhost:1313/articles/) and the [article page](http://localhost:1313/articles/). If you want to use anything in the website build code, be my guest! I only ask that you [collaboration guidelines](/hidden/collaboration_guidelines_hidden/) first.

If you'd like to get in contact to ideate or collaborate, please do! Contact me at josh.purtell@yale.edu or joshuampurtell@protonmail.ch. If you get in touch via the latter address, please either do so using a *@protonmail.ch email account, or send your PGP key along with your first correspondence per [best practices](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-to-use-pgp/).

N.B. Processing Stochasticities is currently in build 0.1.0. This means that it is in a state of active development and is liable to breakage. If you notice any such breakage, please check the current [build plan](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/webpage/issues/1) and then generate a new [issue](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/webpage/issues) if you think it could be in my blind spot.
