Hi! I'm an undergraduate at Yale University studying Mathematics and Economics. 

Processing Stochasticities is intended to allow me to capture my thoughts and academic experience in a way that is available to others for both scrutiny and (possibly) edification. Such is divided into [shortform](), where I host most of my treatments of papers and the like, and [longform](), where I keep longer treatments which are reserved only for those works which I feel merit the investment of my time.

In case you'd like to learn a bit about *me*, you can do so at a sister site which I keep for this purpose. [Here](/hidden/about_hidden/) be dragons.

If you want to use anything in the website build code, be my guest! I only ask that you [collaboration guidelines](/hidden/collaboration_guidelines_hidden/) first.

N.B. Processing Stochasticities is currently in build 0.1.0. This means that it is in a state of active development and is liable to breakage. If you notice any such breakage, please check the current [build plan](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/webpage/issues/1) and then generate a new [issue](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/webpage/issues) if you think it could be in my blind spot.
