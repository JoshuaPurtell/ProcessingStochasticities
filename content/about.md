Hi. I'm an undergraduate at Yale University studying Mathematics and Economics. With any luck I'll be pursuing a PhD in Economics somewhere in a year or two.

Processing Stochasticities is my public-facing web presence, and is intended to allow me to present a slice of my working and didactic life to you, the reader. I believe strongly in the value of information-sharing and hope that you will profit from the notes and write-ups I share here. A word of warning: most of the notes presented here are [automatically](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/obsidian2d3) generated using the actual notes I take when reading and studying. Obviously, time constraints prevent me from optimizing solely for third-party readability here.

In case you'd like to learn a bit more about *me*, you can do so at a separate page which I keep for this purpose [here](/hidden/about_hidden/).

If you'd like to get in contact to ideate or collaborate (on a project or paper), please do! Contact me @ josh dot purtell at yale dot edu or securely @ joshuampurtell at protonmail dot ch. If you get in touch via the latter address, please either do so using a *@protonmail.ch email account, or send your PGP key along with your first correspondence per [best practices](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-to-use-pgp/).

N.B. Processing Stochasticities is currently in build 0.2.0. This means that it is in a state of active development and is liable to breakage. If you notice any such breakage, please check the current [build plan](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/webpage/issues/1) and then generate a new [issue](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/webpage/issues) if you think it could be in my blind spot.
