## Pollard's Probability and M Theory
This node is meant to constitute a results-oriented technical annotation of Pollard's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Theoretic-Probability-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521002893). Obviously, it would be inappropriate to re-write this textbook; instead, think of these entries as a "highlights" reel of sort which serve to integrate the book into the greater graph and hopefully to make it more valuable as a reference. Here are some of the most valent highlights:
### The Calculus of Sigma Fields
[A Modicum of Measure Theory](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/A_Modicum_Of_Measure_Theory/)
[Densities and Derivatives](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Densities_And_Derivatives/)
