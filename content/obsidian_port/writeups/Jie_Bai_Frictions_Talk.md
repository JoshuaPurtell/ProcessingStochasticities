Search and Information Frictions on E-Commerce Platforms

Entry frictions for sellers low, search frictions (scope of search limited, many firms) & information frictions (hard to discern quality) high

Stylized facts: 
- Significant dispersion (superstars do not completely dominate)
- Quality only weakly predicts sales
- It takes very long for initial orders to come in, but when they do it impacts performance significantly. It may spur advertisement, quality improvement, etc. It may also spur production via demand signal.
- Brushing is punished

Model
- probability of seller being sampled depends on relative visibility
- prior is normal, bayesian updating based on reviews
- perceived demand function depends not on entire market, but effective scope of market search.

Conclusion:
Friction dominates outcomes currently, quality has little impact. When perceived variance is high, consumers favor established players.
