Joe Hazell (Herreno,Nakamura,Steinsson)

New Keynesian formalization for inflation

Phillips curve may be flattening

Anchoring of expectations hypothesis

Mavroeidis 2014, Fitzgerald-Nicolini 2014, McLeay-Tenreyro 2019

Hypothesis: regional estimation can help avoid the problem of monetary policy eliminating demand shocks.

## Power and Problem of Expected Inflation
When equation is decomposed to transitory and permannet components, permanent can be swapped with long-term expectation

AR(1) process

$\pi_t = - \psi u_t + E_t\pi_{t+\infty}+\omega_t$

Imperfectly credible 

Law of iterated expectations

Nested CES demand
GHH preferences
Calvo type rigidity

Tradeable demand spillover instrument

## Conclusions
slope of phillips curve small, apparent "flattening" due to anchoring of expectations

underperforms for volker period â€” disinflation was likely due to long-run expectations.
