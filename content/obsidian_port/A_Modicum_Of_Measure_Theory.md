### Highlights

#### Measures and Sigma Fields pp18-22:
A [probability space](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Probability_Space/) is represented by the tuple $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},\mu)$, where $\mathcal{X}$ represents a given set, $\mathcal{A}$ represents a [Sigma Field](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Sigma_Field/) of subsets of that set, and $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}$.

The *generating class argument* generally takes the form of: $X \in \text{CAT}$, $Y \subset X \Rightarrow \text{CAT}(Y) \subset \text{CAT}(X)$, where $\text{CAT}$ is a category and $\text{CAT}()$ is a closure operator. Pollard uses the [generating class argument](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Generating_Class_Argument/) in an instructive proof sketch of the proposition that $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) = \sigma(\mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is the [Borel Sigma Field](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Borel_Sigma_Field/) and $\mathcal{E}:=\{ (-\infty,t] \subset \mathbb{R}, \forall t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ [Generating Borel Set Proof](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Generating_Borel_Set_Proof/).

The [Lebesgue Measure](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Lebesgue_Measure/) is defined on $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ as $m(a,b]=b-a$, and is extended to the [Lebesgue Sigma Field](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Lebesgue_Sigma_Field/).
