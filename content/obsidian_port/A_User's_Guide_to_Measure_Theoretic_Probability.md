## Pollard's Probability and M Theory
This node is meant to constitute a results-oriented technical annotation of Pollard's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Theoretic-Probability-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521002893). Obviously, it would be inappropriate to re-write this textbook; instead, think of these entries as a "highlights" reel of sort which serve to integrate the book into the greater graph and hopefully to make it more valuable as a reference. Here are some of the most valent highlights:
