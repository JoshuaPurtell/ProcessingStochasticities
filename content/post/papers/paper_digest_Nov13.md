It's time for the weekly paper roundup! My hope is for this segment to roughly reduplicate the write-ups I build on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Generally speaking, the inclusion of a paper on the roundup is not an endorsement, and the amount of text I devote to a given entry is only a noisy indicator of the value I ascribe to it. With that being said, let's jump in.
