### Highlights

#### Measures and Sigma Fields pp18-22:
A probability space is represented by the tuple $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},\mu)$, where $\mathcal{X}$ represents a given set, $\mathcal{A}$ represents a Sigma Field of subsets of that set, and $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}$.

The *generating class argument* generally takes the form of: $X \in \text{CAT}$, $Y \subset X \Rightarrow \text{CAT}(Y) \subset \text{CAT}(X)$, where $\text{CAT}$ is a category and $\text{CAT}()$ is a closure operator. Pollard uses the generating class argument in an instructive proof sketch of the proposition that $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) = \sigma(\mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is the Borel Sigma Field and $\mathcal{E}:=\{ (-\infty,t] \subset \mathbb{R}, \forall t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ Generating Borel Set Proof.

The Lebesgue Measure is defined on $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ as $m(a,b]=b-a$, and is extended to the Lebesgue Sigma Field.
