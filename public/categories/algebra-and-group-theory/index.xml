      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the weekly paper roundup! My hope is for this segment to roughly reduplicate the write-ups I build on Obsidian. Generally speaking, the inclusion of a paper on the roundup is not an endorsement, and the amount of text I devote to a given entry is only a noisy indicator of the value I ascribe to it. With that being said, let&amp;rsquo;s jump in.

      <description>Highlights Measures and Sigma Fields pp18-22: A probability space is represented by the tuple $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},\mu)$, where $\mathcal{X}$ represents a given set, $\mathcal{A}$ represents a Sigma Field of subsets of that set, and $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}$.
The generating class argument generally takes the form of: $X \in \text{CAT}$, $Y \subset X \Rightarrow \text{CAT}(Y) \subset \text{CAT}(X)$, where $\text{CAT}$ is a category and $\text{CAT}()$ is a closure operator. Pollard uses the generating class argument in an instructive proof sketch of the proposition that $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) = \sigma(\mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is the Borel Sigma Field and $\mathcal{E}:={ (-\infty,t] \subset \mathbb{R}, \forall t \in \mathbb{R}}$ Generating Borel Set Proof.</description>
