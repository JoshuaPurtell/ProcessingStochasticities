It still has a long way to go! In order to smooth over the added workload of the developing the page to release 0.5.0, I'll be suspending all new content (including article reviews — I'll still be reading them, so I'll probably try to add these retroactively eventually). Hopefully release 0.5.0 will be out sometime early December, so I won't have to wait for too long
